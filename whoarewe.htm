		<h1>Who are we?</h1>
		<article>
			Gamers Associate is a team of three friends, all hardcore gamers and passionate about the geek/pop culture.<br />
			<br />
			We are working for French IT companies but each of us wishes to bring something new to the field of game, and specifically to video and role playing games. <br />
			This is why we decided to create Gamers Associate, as a launch pad for our projects. <br />
			The purpose of Gamers Associate is twofold: to become a real game company, and to offer original and fun content. <br />
			<br />
			We hope that our first game, Slime Attack, will meet these goals. <br />
			Slime Attack is the result of a long thought process on the creation of innovative and intuitive gameplay mechanisms dedicated to touch screen devices - our objective is not to reproduce an existing game concept with an emulated gamepad.<br />
			This is only the beginning, but the experience is already worth it. <br />
			<br />
			As we stated, we are kids of the pop culture, and we are motivated by a desire to share a storytelling experience. So, our next game will surely be more oriented towards narrative, emotions, and atmosphere. <br />
			Stay tuned! <br />
